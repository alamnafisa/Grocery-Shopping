# Grocery-Shopping
Write a program that allows a user to add products to their shopping cart. You can choose five products for this (e.g., eggs, shoes, pens, etc.) The program should also allow the user to see what they have inside their shopping cart. Allow the user the option to specify they want to check out. Once the checkout is complete, print the item list and total, including taxes.
